# Zootopia-Search
Given a city map in text file as a matrix, find a path from a randomly placed start location to a randomly placed goal location using DFS and A\* search algorithms.

Start position is indicated by "S", the goal position is indicated by "G" and walls are indicated by "%".  Paths cannot cross through walls.  Only horizontal and vertical moves are allowed, not diagonal.
